# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Landing Page Project

I have created a landing page for practice using **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project includes:

- **Lucide Icons**: Used for displaying icons throughout the landing page.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailored to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS utilities.
- **Vite**: Set up with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) to streamline the development process.
